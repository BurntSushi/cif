/*
Package cif provides a reader and a writer for the Crystallographic Information
File (CIF) format. This package corresponds (almost) exactly to version 1.1
of the CIF specification:
http://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/spec/version1.1/cifsyntax

This package should conform to the entirety of the specification, except it
does not enforce maximum line length limits while reading or writing CIF files.
This behavior may be changed in the future.
